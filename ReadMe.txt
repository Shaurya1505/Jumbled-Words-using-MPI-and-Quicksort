The project showcases the use of Message Passing Interface to create a parallel program which can perform unjumbling of words faster than a serial program. Multiple problem sizes are chosen to get the optimal problem size above which the parallel program will always be faster than the serial program.

The project consists of all these elements:

Parallel.c : parallel program source code
serial.c : Serial program source code
jumbled10000.txt : Problem list consisting of 10000 jumbled words
jumbled12000.txt : Problem list consisting of 12000 jumbled words
jumbled14000.txt : Problem list consisting of 14000 jumbled words
jumbled16000.txt : Problem list consisting of 16000 jumbled words
jumbled18000.txt : Problem list consisting of 18000 jumbled words
jumbled20000.txt : Problem list consisting of 20000 jumbled words
words.txt : dictionary words consisisting of actual word forms
Report.pdf : project report consisting of algorithm descriptions and analysis
